                    Responsive design defines as the flexibility around grids and layouts of different devices and platforms. 
                    There are lots of different screen size and platforms that exist In the world. 
                    The changes that are made through using computers to mobile devices are drastic and the layouts and elements
                    of websites have to be matched to proper size depending on devices. 
                    Having a single layout for a website leads to weird situations while using the website. 
                    Requiring user friendly environment is one of the main components to designing a website. 
                    Compatibility and utility should be considered to give comfort and ease to website users.
                    Web pages can take advantage of this to be on different platforms and devices.
                    The ways I have implemented responsive design was to choose two different sizes for the layout styles of the website.
                    I tried several approaches and changes to width to match its resolution and uses. 
                    In addition, I have designed images to fit mobile screens so that certain amounts can be displayed. 
                    Other components such as fonts, elements, size were altered to make changes. The problem I faced was making 
                    the navigation bar appropriate, so I decreased the padding and margin but could not find the proper fit to make it more 
                    neat. It was very hard to figure out a way to fit responsive design and made lots of mistakes due to lack of knowledge.
                    Throughout this assignment, I have learned to design websites and implement responsive design and host it using 
                    static hosting solution so it can be viewed online. Also, finding the right size and space for images and elements 
                    did not seem to be difficult at beginning but had the most problems to deal with. Through this assignment, 
                    I have learned that nothing is easy and lots effort is needed in creating a prefect user interface.
